# ðŸŽ“ Student Marks Analyzer â€“ C++ DSA Mini Project

This is a simple **console-based C++ project** developed as part of my **summer internship/training**, focused on strengthening my understanding of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.

The project analyzes student marks by using core programming concepts like arrays, functions, sorting algorithms, and searching techniques.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Input and store marks for multiple students
- âœ… Calculate:
  - Average marks
  - Maximum and minimum marks
- âœ… Sort marks:
  - Ascending (Bubble Sort)
  - Descending (Selection Sort)
- âœ… Search functionality:
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search (after sorting)
- âœ… Menu-driven console UI for easy interaction

## ðŸ§  Concepts Used

- Arrays
- Functions
- Loops and conditionals
- Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort)
- Searching algorithms (Linear & Binary Search)
- File handling *(optional - for saving output)*
